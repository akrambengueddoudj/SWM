## üõ†Ô∏è Best Practices & Deployment (For Future Versions)

- **Modular Project Structure**:
  - Separation of concerns (backend, frontend, static, config)
  - Reusable components and apps

- **Environment Configuration**:
  - `.env` files for sensitive data (e.g., `SECRET_KEY`, `DATABASE_URL`)
  - Use `django-environ` or `python-decouple` for parsing
  - Separate settings files (`base.py`, `dev.py`, `prod.py`)

- **Static & Media Files**:
  - Use `collectstatic` before deployment
  - Serve via NGINX or CDN
  - Isolated paths for static and media for easier management

- **Database & Caching**:
  - PostgreSQL as primary database
  - Redis for caching and WebSocket layers
  - Regular backups of both DB and media

- **WebSockets & Real-Time**:
  - Django Channels + Redis (in production setup)
  - Daphne or ASGI server as application layer

- **Testing & Linting**:
  - `pytest` for tests, `coverage` for code coverage
  - Code formatting: `black`, `flake8`, `isort`
  - CI integration recommended

---

## üöÄ Deployment Guidelines (For Future Versions)

- **Server Stack**:
  - Ubuntu 20.04+, Python 3.8+
  - Gunicorn or uWSGI (WSGI layer)
  - NGINX (reverse proxy + static/media)
  - Redis (WebSocket + cache)
  - PostgreSQL (production DB)

- **Deployment Steps**:
  - Clone the repo and setup virtual environment
  - Install dependencies from `requirements.txt`
  - Apply migrations and collect static files
  - Configure Gunicorn as WSGI service
  - Setup NGINX to serve static/media and proxy to Gunicorn
  - Secure with HTTPS (Let‚Äôs Encrypt + Certbot)

- **Background Services**:
  - Celery for async tasks (optional)
  - Supervisor/systemd for process monitoring
  - WebSocket support with Channels + Daphne (for real-time dashboard)

- **Security Config**:
  - Enforce HTTPS
  - JWT Authentication
  - Regular rotation of API keys
  - Use firewall/Fail2Ban on production servers
